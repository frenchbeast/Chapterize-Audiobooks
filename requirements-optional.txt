# Optional dependencies for alternative chapter detection methods
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-optional.txt

# For silence-based detection (fastest method)
pydub>=0.25.1

# For faster-whisper detection (recommended method)
# Much faster than Vosk, more accurate
faster-whisper>=0.10.0

# For GPU acceleration (optional, NVIDIA GPUs only)
# Uncomment if you have CUDA-capable GPU:
# faster-whisper[cuda]>=0.10.0

# For hybrid detection (combines silence + whisper)
